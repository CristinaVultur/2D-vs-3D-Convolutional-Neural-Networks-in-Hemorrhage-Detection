# 2D-vs-3D-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-in-Hemorrhage-Detection
The paper studies the development and comparison of two convolutional neural network ResNet architectures, a 2D convolution and a 3D, for intracranial haemorrhage detection and classification problem in CT images. The paper can be found in the file "Vultur Cristina licenta", it has the details about the architectures chosen and implementation, the theory applied and code explanation.
